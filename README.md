# Revenue Analysis
Final practical exam to achieve the data analysis professional certificate in Datacamp Platform.

In this project we need to know:
- How many customers were there for each approach?
- What does the spread of the revenue look like overall? And for each method?
- Was there any difference in revenue over time for each of the methods?
- Based on the data, which method would you recommend we continue to use? Some
of these methods take more time from the team so they may not be the best for us
to use if the results are similar.

About Pens and Printers (client):
Pens and Printers was founded in 1984 and provides high quality office products to large
organizations. We are a trusted provider of everything from pens and notebooks to desk
chairs and monitors. We don’t produce our own products but sell those made by other
companies.
We have built long lasting relationships with our customers and they trust us to provide them
with the best products for them. As the way in which consumers buy products is changing,
our sales tactics have to change too. Launching a new product line is expensive and we need
to make sure we are using the best techniques to sell the new product effectively. The best
approach may vary for each new product so we need to learn quickly what works and what
doesn’t.
